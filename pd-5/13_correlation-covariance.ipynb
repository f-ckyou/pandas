    "### Covariance\n",
    "- **Definition**: Covariance measures how two variables vary together.  \n",
    "  - A positive covariance indicates that the variables tend to move in the same direction.  \n",
    "  - A negative covariance indicates that they move in opposite directions.\n",
    "  - A value of zero suggests no relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Key Points:\n",
    "  - Units: Covariance is sensitive to the scale of the data, meaning its value depends on the units of the variables.\n",
    "  - Use: Covariance gives an idea of the **direction** of the relationship but not the **strength**.\n",

    "### Correlation\n",
    "- **Definition**: Correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It is a scaled version of covariance, bounded between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\).\n",

    "  - -1: Perfect negative linear relationship.\n",
    "  - 0: No linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Key Points:\n",
    "  - Units: Correlation is unitless and standardized, making it easier to compare across datasets.\n",
